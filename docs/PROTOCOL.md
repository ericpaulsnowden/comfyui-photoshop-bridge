# cpsb Protocol & Interface Contract

This document is the single source of truth for every interface between the three
components of comfyui-photoshop-bridge: the Python backend (registered on ComfyUI's
PromptServer), the ComfyUI frontend extension (`web/js/`), and the Photoshop UXP
plugin (`photoshop_plugin/`). If an implementation and this document disagree, the
implementation is wrong or this document must be amended first — never drift silently.

Referenced design rationale lives in `/PLAN.md` (repo parent) — section numbers cited as (§N).

---

## 1. Identifiers & filesystem layout

- `handoff_id`: 8-char lowercase hex, generated with `uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]`, unique per
  handoff. Treated as an unguessable capability token (§3 security): routes that read or
  mutate a specific handoff require it and return 404 for unknown/inactive ids.
- Managed folder, one per handoff, under ComfyUI's input directory. The parent folder
  name is the `managed_folder_name` setting (default `"photoshop"`; §2 settings). It is
  written to `meta.json` per handoff (`managed_dir`) and included in the subfolder of
  every emitted image reference, so the **frontend never hardcodes it** — it derives the
  subfolder entirely from server events and `/cpsb/*` responses. `<managed>` below stands
  for that configured name:

```
input/<managed>/<handoff_id>/
    source.psd        # the PSD handed to Photoshop (Tier 1 opens this path directly)
    meta.json         # authoritative handoff state (schema below)
    orig_thumb.png    # thumbnail of the ORIGINAL image, max 256px long side (gallery before/after)
    edit_001.png ...  # ingested edits, in arrival order (edit_%03d.png)
```

- There is **no separate session manifest file**: on server start, the backend rebuilds
  its in-memory state by scanning `input/<managed>/*/meta.json` (the meta files are the
  source of truth; this supersedes PLAN §3's `session_manifest.json` — one file fewer,
  same restart guarantee). Changing `managed_folder_name` takes effect at next server
  start and applies to new handoffs; handoffs already living under the previous name stay
  where they are (their `meta.managed_dir` records which folder they belong to).
- Handoffs with status `edited`, `cancelled`, `discarded`, `superseded`, or `error` older
  than `cleanup_days` (default 14) are purged (folder deleted) at server start.
  `pending`/`editing` handoffs are never auto-purged.

### meta.json schema

```json
{
  "handoff_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "origin_node_id": "17",
  "origin_kind": "load_image" | "terminal_output" | "bridge_node" | "load_psd",
  "workflow_name": "my-workflow",
  "source_hash": "<sha256 hex of the original image's normalized PNG encoding>",
  "source": {"filename": "ComfyUI_00042_.png", "subfolder": "", "type": "output"},
  "created_ts": 1752680000.0,
  "updated_ts": 1752680123.4,
  "status": "pending" | "editing" | "edited" | "cancelled" | "discarded" | "superseded" | "error",
  "error": null,
  "edits": [
    {"filename": "edit_001.png", "ts": 1752680123.4,
     "fidelity": "composite" | "recomposite" | "plugin",
     "sibling_output": {"filename": "ComfyUI_00042_ps1.png", "subfolder": ""}
    }
  ]
}
```

Status transitions:
`pending` (created) → `editing` (open confirmed: Tier 1 OS-launch succeeded, or plugin sent
`opened`) → `edited` (≥1 edit ingested; stays `edited` as further saves append to `edits`).
`cancelled` (user cancel), `discarded` (gallery discard), `superseded` (replaced by a
"Start Fresh Edit"), `error` (open/ingest failure, with `error` string) are terminal.
"Stale" is **not** a status — the frontend derives it (`editing` and `updated_ts` older
than 1h).

`fidelity` records how the edit's pixels were produced: `composite` = embedded
Maximize-Compatibility composite (Tier 1 best case), `recomposite` = psd-tools re-render
fallback (Tier 1, user declined Maximize Compatibility — imperfect fidelity),
`plugin` = final pixels delivered as-is via `/cpsb/upload` — both the UXP plugin's own
flattened PNG export (Tier 2) and a manual gallery drag-drop import map here, since
neither is derived by this backend.

Additional field semantics:
- `source_hash`: sha256 of the original image's normalized PNG bytes, written at
  creation. The bridge node compares it against its current input to decide whether an
  existing handoff still corresponds to the same image (§6); missing on legacy metas →
  treated as matching.
- Cleanup age is measured on `updated_ts` (last activity), not `created_ts`.
- Active-handoff lookup (`mode:"new"` 409 check, "Edit Original" targeting) is scoped by
  `workflow_name` when both the request's and the candidate's names are non-empty; an
  empty name on either side is a wildcard (unsaved workflows, bridge handoffs).

---

## 2. HTTP routes

All routes are registered on `PromptServer.instance.routes` (same port as ComfyUI, no
extra server). JSON errors use `{"error": "<human-readable message>"}` with the status
codes below.

### POST `/cpsb/open`
Create a handoff and open it in Photoshop. Body (JSON):

```json
{
  "filename": "ComfyUI_00042_.png",
  "subfolder": "",
  "type": "output",              // "input" | "output" | "temp" — same triple as /view
  "origin_node_id": "17",         // graph node id as string
  "origin_kind": "load_image",    // "load_image" | "terminal_output" | "bridge_node"
  "workflow_name": "my-workflow", // optional, for the gallery
  "mode": "new"                   // "new" | "original" | "fresh"
}
```

- `mode:"new"`: no active handoff expected for this node. If one exists (status
  `pending`/`editing`/`edited`), respond **409** with
  `{"error": ..., "existing_handoff_id": "..."}` — the frontend then shows
  "Edit Original / Start Fresh" and re-calls with the chosen mode.
- `client_remote_ok` (optional bool, default false): acknowledges the client-locality
  gate below. When the Tier 1 path would be used AND the requesting client is not on
  the server's machine AND this flag is absent, respond **428** with
  `{"error": ..., "reason": "client_remote", "server_name": "<platform.node()>"}` —
  the frontend shows a confirm ("Photoshop will open on <server_name>, not this
  computer") and re-sends with `client_remote_ok: true` if the user proceeds (choice
  remembered per-browser in localStorage; only the affirmative is persisted). A connected Tier 2 plugin in REMOTE mode bypasses this gate (the plugin is on a
  different machine than the server — almost certainly the one the user is at). A
  plugin in LOCAL mode does NOT bypass it: local mode means the plugin sits on the
  server's own machine, so for a remote browser the document would still open on the
  wrong screen — the same confirm applies.
- `mode:"original"`: re-open the existing handoff's `source.psd` (layers preserved).
  Requires `existing` handoff for the node; 404 otherwise.
- `mode:"fresh"`: mark the existing handoff `superseded`, then proceed as `new`.

Success **200**: `{"handoff_id": "...", "tier": 1 | 2, "status": "pending"}`.
Errors: **404** source image not found; **400** malformed body; **503** neither tier
available (Tier 1 gated off — headless/container/remote — and no plugin connected),
body includes `{"tier1_available": false, "tier2_connected": false}`.
The response is **200 with `status:"pending"` even if the launch attempt itself then
fails** — the contract's error codes cover pre-launch validation only; launch outcome
is conveyed asynchronously via `cpsb.status` (`editing` on success, `error` on failure).

**PSD-native sources (`origin_kind: "load_psd"`)**: the `{filename, subfolder, type}`
triple points at a `.psd`/`.psb` the user loaded (Load PSD node). Handoff creation
COPIES that file verbatim as `source.psd` — never `write_psd`/`frompil` — so the user
edits a file with their layers intact; the ORIGINAL stays untouched (non-destructive).
`source_hash` = sha256 of the raw PSD bytes (not a PNG encoding). The thumbnail comes
from the §4 flatten of the copy.

Tier selection: if a UXP plugin websocket is currently connected → Tier 2 (send
`open_handoff` over WS); else if Tier 1 available → OS-launch Photoshop with the PSD
path. Tier 1's watchdog stays armed in both tiers (§5 — redundant detector; first
ingest wins, duplicates are idempotent by file hash).

### POST `/cpsb/upload`
Deliver edited pixels (Tier 2 plugin, or manual gallery drag-drop import).
`multipart/form-data`: `handoff_id` (field), `image` (PNG file part),
`source` (field, `"plugin"` | `"manual"`).

Accepted only when handoff status is `pending`, `editing`, or `edited` — otherwise
**409**. Unknown id **404**. On success the backend ingests (see §4 of this doc),
responds **200** `{"ok": true, "filename": "edit_002.png", "subfolder": "cpsb/<id>",
"type": "input"}`. A duplicate upload (SHA256-identical to the latest edit — the
watchdog and plugin may both report one save) is idempotent: **200** with the existing
latest edit's filename, no new edit recorded.

### GET `/cpsb/file/{handoff_id}`
Returns `source.psd` bytes (`Content-Type: image/vnd.adobe.photoshop`). Used by the
plugin in remote mode. 404 for unknown id or non-active status.

### POST `/cpsb/cancel/{handoff_id}`
Marks the handoff `cancelled`, unblocks a waiting bridge node (which then raises
`InterruptProcessingException`), notifies the plugin (`handoff_cancelled`), and emits
`cpsb.status` with `cancelled` so the node badge and gallery clear. 200 `{"ok": true}`;
404 unknown. This is the authoritative way to clear a handoff stuck in `editing` — e.g.
the user opened Photoshop and closed the document without saving, which produces no file
event in Tier 1 and so would otherwise sit in `editing` indefinitely. The frontend
surfaces it directly on the node's "Editing in Photoshop…" badge (hover → cancel) and in
the gallery; cancelling is always available immediately, not gated on the stale timeout.
Idempotent: cancelling an already-terminal handoff returns 200 and is a no-op. Any edit
that arrives after cancellation (a late save landing on a cancelled handoff) is ignored
by the ingest path (status not in `ACTIVE_STATUSES`).

### POST `/cpsb/discard/{handoff_id}`
Gallery "Discard" for stale handoffs: same as cancel but sets `discarded`. 200/404.

### GET `/cpsb/status`
```json
{
  "server_version": "0.2.0",
  "tier1_available": true,
  "tier1_reason": null,            // or "headless-server" | "no-photoshop" | ...
  "tier2_connected": false,
  "ps_version": null,               // e.g. "26.5" when plugin connected
  "handoffs": [ <meta.json objects, newest first, max 200> ]
}
```

### GET `/cpsb/thumb/{handoff_id}`
Returns `orig_thumb.png` bytes. (Edited-image thumbnails are fetched via ComfyUI's own
`/view?filename=edit_00N.png&subfolder=cpsb/<id>&type=input`.)

### GET `/cpsb/settings` / POST `/cpsb/settings`
Backend-persisted settings (stored at `<user_dir>/cpsb.json`), JSON object:
`{"photoshop_path": "", "debounce_ms": 800, "cleanup_days": 14, "sibling_outputs": true,
"managed_folder_name": "photoshop"}`.
POST merges partial updates and returns the full object. `managed_folder_name` is
sanitized to a single safe path segment (no separators, no `..`); an invalid value falls
back to the default. (Frontend-only preferences — auto-queue toggle — use ComfyUI's
settings API instead, id prefix `cpsb.`.)

### GET `/cpsb/ws`
WebSocket upgrade endpoint for the UXP plugin. Protocol in §3 of this doc.

---

## 3. Plugin websocket protocol

Text frames, one JSON object per frame, every message has `"type"`. Unknown types are
ignored (forward compatibility). The server allows **one** plugin connection; a new
connection replaces the old (old socket closed with code 4000).

Plugin → server:
- `{"type": "hello", "plugin_version": "0.1.0", "ps_version": "26.5", "uxp_version": "8.1"}`
  Server replies `hello_ack`. Sent once per connection, first message.
- `{"type": "ready", "local_mode": true}` — after the plugin probes whether
  `input_cpsb_path` from `hello_ack` exists on its local filesystem. `local_mode:true`
  → `open_handoff` uses the shared path and `POST /cpsb/upload` for edits; `false` →
  REMOTE mode, where BOTH the PSD download and the edit upload move onto this same
  websocket (`request_file` / `upload_edit` below) instead of HTTP. UXP's runtime blocks
  cleartext `http://` to a non-localhost host but not `ws://` (and `http://localhost` is
  separately exempt, which is why LOCAL mode's HTTP never needed this) — REMOTE mode's
  `fetch()` calls to a remote ComfyUI simply fail, so both directions ride the control
  websocket that is already open and already proven to work cross-machine.
- `{"type": "opened", "handoff_id": "...", "document_id": 123}` — document open
  succeeded; server sets status `editing`.
- `{"type": "open_failed", "handoff_id": "...", "error": "..."}` — server sets status
  `error`. If the plugin is in LOCAL mode (same machine as the server), the server falls
  back to a Tier 1 OS-open if available. For a REMOTE-mode plugin it does **not** fall
  back — a server-side launch would open Photoshop on the wrong machine (the server, not
  the machine the user is at) — leaving the handoff in `error` with the plugin's message
  so the real failure is visible.
- `{"type": "save_detected", "handoff_id": "..."}` — informational (UI badge); pixels
  follow via POST `/cpsb/upload` (LOCAL mode) or `upload_edit` (REMOTE mode).
- `{"type": "request_file", "handoff_id": "..."}` — REMOTE-mode PSD download (replaces a
  `fetch` of `GET /cpsb/file/{handoff_id}`, which UXP blocks for a non-localhost host).
  Server replies with one or more `file_chunk`s or a `file_error`, reading the exact same
  path and the exact same guard (`ACTIVE_STATUSES`) `GET /cpsb/file/{handoff_id}` uses.
- `{"type": "upload_edit", "handoff_id": "...", "seq": 0, "total": 3, "data_b64": "...",
  "fidelity": "plugin"}` — one chunk of a REMOTE-mode edit upload (replaces a `fetch`
  POST to `/cpsb/upload`, same UXP restriction). `fidelity` is sent on every chunk for
  simplicity (a self-contained frame, no reliance on remembering seq 0's value) but is
  only actually read once, when the upload completes. See "File transfer chunking"
  below for how chunks are produced/reassembled. Server replies `upload_ok` once every
  chunk `0..total-1` has arrived and the reassembled bytes decode and ingest cleanly, or
  `upload_error` otherwise.
- `{"type": "pong"}`

Server → plugin:
- `{"type": "hello_ack", "server_version": "0.1.0", "input_cpsb_path": "/abs/path/to/input/cpsb"}`
- `{"type": "open_handoff", "handoff_id": "...", "psd_path": "/abs/.../source.psd", "file_url": "/cpsb/file/<id>"}`
  Plugin opens `psd_path` directly in LOCAL mode. In REMOTE mode the plugin downloads the
  PSD via `request_file`/`file_chunk` over this websocket (above) rather than fetching
  `file_url` — `file_url` is still included in this message for backward compatibility
  and manual/diagnostic use (`GET /cpsb/file/{handoff_id}` itself is unchanged and still
  works, e.g. from a browser on the server's own LAN) but the plugin no longer calls it.
  Plugin records document↔handoff mapping either way (path-keyed local, documentID-keyed
  remote) and replies `opened`/`open_failed`.
- `{"type": "file_chunk", "handoff_id": "...", "seq": 0, "total": 3, "data_b64": "..."}` —
  one chunk of a `request_file` response. See "File transfer chunking" below.
- `{"type": "file_error", "handoff_id": "...", "error": "..."}` — `request_file` failed:
  unknown/inactive `handoff_id`, or the file is missing/unreadable server-side. Sent
  instead of any `file_chunk`, never after one.
- `{"type": "upload_ok", "handoff_id": "..."}` — a REMOTE-mode `upload_edit` was fully
  reassembled and ingested (or was an idempotent duplicate of the latest edit — same
  "no error" treatment `POST /cpsb/upload` gives a duplicate).
- `{"type": "upload_error", "handoff_id": "...", "error": "...", "reason": "unknown_handoff" |
  "inactive" | "invalid_image" | "malformed"}` — a REMOTE-mode `upload_edit` failed.
  `reason` mirrors `POST /cpsb/upload`'s HTTP status codes so a client can decide whether
  retrying makes sense: `unknown_handoff`/`inactive` are the 404/409 equivalents (retrying
  identical bytes can never change the outcome); `invalid_image`/`malformed` are left
  retryable, matching the HTTP path's own behavior of still retrying after a 400.
- `{"type": "handoff_cancelled", "handoff_id": "..."}` — stop tracking that document.
- `{"type": "ping"}` — every 30s; plugin must `pong` within 15s or the server closes
  the socket (plugin reconnects with backoff).

**File transfer chunking (`request_file`/`file_chunk` and `upload_edit`):** both
directions use the identical scheme. The sender base64-encodes the ENTIRE file ONCE,
then slices that single string into fixed-size pieces (~700,000 characters, comfortably
inside a "~512KB–1MB base64 chunk" target) sent as successive frames carrying the same
`handoff_id`, an increasing `seq` starting at 0, and a constant `total` (chunk count).
The receiver's job is only "concatenate every chunk's `data_b64` in `seq` order, then
base64-decode ONCE at the end" — chunks are never independently decodable, which avoids
any per-chunk base64 padding/alignment subtlety (padding only ever appears at the very
end of the full encoded string). A zero-byte file still produces exactly one chunk
(`total: 1`, `data_b64: ""`), never a degenerate empty stream. The server's plugin
websocket is opened with a generous inbound `max_msg_size` (8 MiB) as a safety margin —
chunking already keeps every real frame well under 1MB on its own.

**Server address (plugin-side, user-configurable):** the plugin targets a single
`host:port` base (default `localhost:8188`), from which it derives both the WebSocket
URL (`ws://<base>/cpsb/ws`) and the HTTP origin (`http://<base>`, used only for LOCAL
mode's `POST /cpsb/upload` — REMOTE mode no longer makes any HTTP call at all, having
moved both `GET /cpsb/file/*` and `POST /cpsb/upload` onto the websocket above). It is
editable from the panel's Advanced section ("ComfyUI server"); the value is persisted
plugin-side under the `localStorage` key `cpsb.serverBase` (falling back to
in-session-only if localStorage is unavailable) and applying a new address triggers a
clean reconnect — the current socket is torn down, the backoff/attempt state reset, and
the hello/ready handshake re-run against the new URL. Default localhost use is
unchanged. Cross-machine use — Photoshop on one computer, ComfyUI on another — requires
(a) the plugin manifest's `network.domains` set to the catch-all `"all"` (arbitrary
user-entered hosts cannot be enumerated ahead of time, so the localhost-only allowlist is
widened; a least-privilege allowlist is a possible follow-up for a locked-down release)
— needed for the `ws://` connection to an arbitrary host, which is the only network
capability REMOTE mode now depends on — and (b) the ComfyUI server reachable over the
network, i.e. started with `--listen`.

---

## 4. Ingest pipeline (backend, both tiers)

One function, `ingest_edit(handoff_id, pixels_or_path, fidelity)`, is the convergence
point (PLAN §3 `mark_edited`): Tier 1 watchdog-settled PSD reads and Tier 2 uploads both
end here. It:
1. Writes `edit_%03d.png` into the handoff folder (which lives under `input/`, so the
   result is addressable as `subfolder="cpsb/<id>", type="input"` by LoadImage widgets
   and `/view`).
2. Skips ingestion if the new edit's SHA256 equals the previous edit's (idempotency —
   the watchdog and plugin may both fire for one save).
3. If `origin_kind == "terminal_output"` and the source was in `output/` and setting
   `sibling_outputs` is on: also writes `<origname>_ps<N>.png` next to the original
   output file and records it as `sibling_output` in the edit entry.
4. Updates `meta.json` (status `edited`, appends to `edits`).
5. Unblocks a waiting bridge node for this handoff, if any.
6. Emits `cpsb.updated` (below).

Tier 1 PSD read: try the embedded Maximize-Compatibility composite first
(fidelity `composite`); if absent, re-composite via psd-tools (fidelity `recomposite`).
16-bit / non-RGB modes are converted to RGB8 (PLAN §4); alpha is preserved when present.
A read that still fails after the retry budget is **non-terminal**: the watcher logs and
leaves the handoff `editing` so the next save retries ingestion — it must never move a
handoff to `error` (terminal statuses would silently drop all subsequent saves).

**Mask channel extraction: REMOVED (owner's call, 2026-07-17)** — field testing showed
transparency-based masking covers the need; extra-channel extraction was dropped for
simplicity. MASK outputs derive from image alpha only (see §6/§6b). Git history and
research/research-annotate-node.md retain the design if ever revisited.

---

## 5. Frontend events (server → ComfyUI frontend via send_sync)

- `"cpsb.updated"` — an edit arrived:
  ```json
  {"handoff_id": "...", "origin_node_id": "17", "origin_kind": "load_image",
   "filename": "edit_002.png", "subfolder": "cpsb/a1b2c3d4", "type": "input",
   "fidelity": "plugin",
   "sibling_output": null }
  ```
- `"cpsb.status"` — handoff lifecycle changed (badge/gallery refresh):
  `{"handoff_id": "...", "origin_node_id": "17", "status": "editing"}`
- `"cpsb.tier2"` — plugin connection state changed:
  `{"connected": true, "ps_version": "26.5"}`

**Universal cancel (product-owner requirement 2026-07-17):** ANY node that shows the
"Editing in Photoshop…" badge (badges.js) MUST expose a working cancel ✕, regardless of
node type or whether the node has an image preview — imageless nodes (Edit in Photoshop,
Annotate for Edit, Compose Layers to PSD) included. A stuck editing badge with no cancel
is the worst failure mode, especially when Photoshop opened on a different (server)
machine the user can't reach. Cancel calls /cpsb/cancel (§2).

A blocking wait (`HandoffManager.wait_for_edit`) must ALSO honor two non-badge escape
hatches, so a node can never wedge until its timeout: (a) ComfyUI's OWN "Cancel current
run" — the wait polls `comfy.model_management.processing_interrupted()` and returns
promptly; and (b) the handoff transitioning to a terminal ERROR (e.g. the plugin's
`open_failed`) — the wait returns `WaitOutcome.ERROR` at once instead of spinning until
`timeout_seconds`. Both, like cancel/timeout, make the node raise
`InterruptProcessingException`.

Frontend paste-back behavior on `cpsb.updated` is specified in PLAN §3 (clipspace-style
widget update for `load_image`/`bridge_node`; cosmetic preview + toast with
"[Add as node]" for `terminal_output`). Auto-queue policy:
- `load_image` and `load_psd` origins: queue when the `cpsb.autoQueue` setting is on.
  (For `load_psd`, paste-back never rewrites the node's file widget — the edit is
  consumed by the node's own execute()/IS_CHANGED, §6b.)
- `bridge_node` origins: queue IFF the origin node's `mode` widget is
  `"Re-run on every save"` (§6) — the node-level mode overrides the global setting
  (an explicit per-node choice must not be silently disabled elsewhere). For the
  other two modes, NEVER: a blocking bridge node delivers the arriving edit
  downstream inside the run completing at that moment, so a re-queue would run the
  entire workflow (and its SaveImage nodes) again per save — the field-reported
  "one click saved multiple files" loop. This is safe by construction: blocking mode
  never auto-queues, and re-run mode never blocks, so no edit is ever both consumed
  in-run and re-queued.

---

## 6. Bridge node

- Class `PhotoshopBridge` (stable node id — saved workflows depend on it), display name
  "Edit in Photoshop", category `image/photoshop`.
- Inputs: `image` (IMAGE); `mode` (COMBO, exactly these strings — the frontend matches
  on them: `"Wait for first save"` (default) | `"Re-run on every save"` |
  `"Open only (don't wait)"`); `timeout_seconds` (INT, default 1800, min 10, max
  86400 — applies only to "Wait for first save"). Hidden: `unique_id` (UNIQUE_ID),
  `prompt` (PROMPT), `extra_pnginfo` (EXTRA_PNGINFO). (This replaces the earlier
  `wait_for_edit` BOOLEAN — pre-release breaking change, no migration shim.)
- Mode semantics:
  - "Wait for first save": block in execute() until the first save arrives, deliver it
    downstream in the same run, done. Later saves into the still-open document are
    still ingested (gallery stays current; next MANUAL queue consumes the latest) but
    never trigger a run.
  - "Re-run on every save": never blocks. First run opens Photoshop and passes the
    input through unchanged; each subsequent save auto-queues a re-run (frontend §5
    policy) which consumes the latest edit — live-iterate mode. No timeout involved.
  - "Open only (don't wait)": passthrough + fire-and-forget open; saves are ingested
    and consumed on the next manual queue only.
- Outputs: (IMAGE, MASK). MASK = `1 - alpha` of the edit image (LoadImage parity)
  when transparency is present, else an all-zero mask sized to the image.
- Execute (edit-consumption semantics): if an active handoff for this node already has
  an edit AND its `source_hash` matches the current input, that edit is returned
  immediately WITHOUT re-opening Photoshop — re-execution is the "consume the edit"
  path (a literal always-reopen reading would demand a new save on every re-queue, an
  open loop). If the `source_hash` differs (upstream re-generated), the old handoff is
  superseded and a fresh one is created and opened. Otherwise (no handoff, or no edit
  yet): saves the incoming image to a handoff (origin_kind `bridge_node`, keyed to
  `unique_id`), opens Photoshop (tier-selected), then if `wait_for_edit` blocks in a
  `while ... time.sleep(0.2)` poll on the shared pending-table until edited / cancelled
  / timeout (the latter two raise `InterruptProcessingException`; ComfyUI's own
  interruption notice is the user-facing signal). The wait must also detect an edit
  that landed between the open call and wait registration (edits-count snapshot, not
  waiter-flag alone). On timeout the handoff stays `editing` — a later save or re-queue
  resumes the same PSD with layers intact. If `wait_for_edit` is False: opens Photoshop
  (fire-and-forget) and passes the input through unchanged; a prior matching edit, when
  one exists, is returned as above.
- `IS_CHANGED`: SHA256 of the latest edit file for this node's active handoff (or a
  constant when none) — an arriving edit changes the hash and forces downstream
  re-execution on the next queue, matching LoadImage semantics.

---

### 6b. Load PSD node

- Class `PhotoshopLoadPSD` (unique id — plain "LoadPSD" collides with other packs),
  display name "Load PSD", category `image/photoshop`.
- Inputs: `psd` (COMBO of `.psd`/`.psb` files in the input directory, refreshed like
  LoadImage's combo) — the frontend adds a custom upload widget (accept `.psd,.psb`,
  hand-rolled input + POST to ComfyUI's own `/upload/image`; the stock IMAGEUPLOAD
  widget hardcodes png/jpeg/webp). Hidden: `unique_id`.
- Outputs: (IMAGE, MASK) — §4 read path (embedded composite → recomposite fallback,
  RGB8 normalize); MASK = `1 - alpha` of the flattened image, else zeros.
- Round trip: right-click → Open in Photoshop creates a `load_psd` handoff (§2 copy
  semantics). While an ACTIVE handoff for this node has a matching `source_hash` and
  edits, execute() returns the latest edit (and its mask) instead of re-flattening the
  original — the PhotoshopBridge consume pattern. `IS_CHANGED`: sha256 of the PSD
  file's raw bytes, combined with the latest edit hash when an active matching handoff
  exists.
- **Edit-original option**: the node carries a BOOLEAN widget `edit_original` (default
  False). Default (False) = the current copy-to-handoff behavior (non-destructive). When
  True, `/cpsb/open` for this node does NOT copy — the handoff's watched target IS the
  user's selected input PSD in place (`edit_in_place: true` + the source triple on the
  open body); Photoshop opens the real file, plain Cmd+S overwrites it, and the watcher
  must watch that exact file path (outside the managed folder), ingesting the user's own
  saved PSD directly. On such a handoff, `orig_thumb`/`source.psd`-copy are skipped; the
  edit is read from the original path. Terminal cleanup never deletes the user's file
  (only managed-folder artifacts are ever purged). This is the only path where a bridge
  handoff points at a file the user owns — guard every delete accordingly.
- **Save-trigger policy** (v0.5.21): the node carries a COMBO widget `on_save`, appended
  as the LAST required input (ComfyUI restores a saved workflow's widget values BY
  POSITION — see `LGraphNode`'s `widgets_values` zip — so appending is the only placement
  that leaves existing workflows untouched). Values, from `cpsb/load_psd.py`'s
  `OnSaveMode`:
  - `"Re-run workflow"` (default) — today's behavior exactly: ingest the edit and let the
    frontend re-queue the graph.
  - `"Update only (don't re-run)"` — ingest the edit so the NEXT manual run picks it up,
    but never auto-queue.
  - `"Ignore (do nothing)"` — do not ingest at all; saving in Photoshop does nothing.
    This is what makes "open a PSD, hide all but one layer, push that layer back, close
    without saving" workable without the graph firing on every save.
- The policy is read from the node's widget at OPEN time, sent on `/cpsb/open` as
  `trigger_policy` (validated there; 400 on an unknown value; omitted → server default),
  and PERSISTED on the handoff (`HandoffMeta.trigger_policy`; a meta.json written before
  this existed falls back to the default). Same contract as `edit_in_place`: changing the
  widget on an ALREADY-open handoff has no effect until the next open.
- **Enforced SERVER-SIDE**, via one shared gate `HandoffManager.should_ingest()`, consulted
  at all three ingest call sites — `POST /cpsb/upload`, the websocket `upload_edit` chunk
  handler, and `CpsbWatcher._ingest_settled`. The frontend cannot be the only guard: the
  plugin uploads with no browser tab open at all, and this must equally govern the Tier-1
  watcher save and BOTH of the plugin's manual Send paths, which all funnel through
  `deliverEdit` → `ingest_edit`. A suppressed upload returns a SUCCESS-shaped response
  (`{"ok": true, "ignored": true}` / `upload_ok`) and logs at INFO — the plugin did nothing
  wrong, and a user who forgot they set Ignore needs it diagnosable from the console.
- `maybeAutoQueue` (frontend) additionally refuses to queue for `Update only`/`Ignore`.
  Precedence: the global `cpsb.autoQueue` setting is checked FIRST, so per-node OFF wins
  over global ON, and global OFF still wins over per-node `Re-run workflow`.
- The policy string is duplicated across four layers that cannot import one another
  (`load_psd.OnSaveMode`, `handoff.TriggerPolicy`, `routes._VALID_TRIGGER_POLICIES`,
  `pasteback.js`'s constants). `tests/test_load_psd.py`'s drift guard asserts all four
  agree, reading the JS as text — rewording one in isolation would otherwise silently stop
  a policy being honored, with no type error anywhere.
- Frontend: the node type is allowlisted in `captureImageUploadType`'s detection (its
  hand-rolled widget bypasses the stock `image_upload` spec flag), and its context-menu
  origin_kind derives as `load_psd`.
- **Preview** (no Photoshop plugin required): the node shows a canvas preview of the
  selected PSD, like LoadImage does for a PNG. `GET /cpsb/psd_preview?filename=&subfolder=&type=`
  (defaults `subfolder=""`, `type="input"`; params mirror `/view` but default to the
  `input/` tree the combo draws from) flattens the PSD server-side via §4's read path
  (embedded composite → recomposite fallback — no plugin, no Photoshop) and caches the
  result content-addressed under `<temp>/cpsb/psdpreview_<sha256>.png`. Response is
  always 200: `{filename, subfolder:"cpsb", type:"temp"}` (addressable by ComfyUI's own
  `/view`) on success, or an all-null triple if flattening fails (logged, never a 500);
  400 for a missing/invalid `filename`/`type`/extension, 404 for a missing or
  traversal-escaping file. The frontend refreshes the preview (debounced, with a
  monotonic token guard against stale responses) whenever the combo value changes and
  on workflow load; failures degrade silently to no preview.

### 6c. Compose Layers to PSD node

- Class `PhotoshopComposePSD`, display name "Compose Layers to PSD", category
  `image/photoshop`.
- Frontend gives it AUTO-GROWING image inputs: `image_1`, `image_2`, … — connecting one
  reveals the next empty socket (pattern forked from rgthree's MIT implementation, with
  attribution comment). Backend accepts any number ≥ 1 via optional inputs. Each socket
  carries a ComfyUI IMAGE, which may be a multi-image BATCH (e.g. a VAE Decode emitting
  several images) — every image in every batch becomes its own layer (frames expanded in
  batch order within a socket, sockets in `image_1..image_N` order).
- Widgets: `group_name` (STRING, default "ComfyUI Layers" — the group/folder the layers
  land in), `layer_name` (STRING, default "Layer" — each layer is named `<layer_name> N`,
  N counting 1..N bottom-to-top), `mode` (COMBO — the SAME three strings as the Edit in
  Photoshop node's BridgeMode: "Wait for first save" (default) | "Re-run on every save" |
  "Don't open (composite only)"). (`mode` replaces the earlier `edit_after` BOOLEAN;
  `layer_name` replaces the removed `filename_prefix` — both pre-release breaking changes.
  `filename_prefix` was dropped because it only named an intermediate file the user never
  sees: Photoshop opens the managed `source.psd` copy, not that file.) `timeout_seconds`
  (INT, default 1800) applies to "Wait for first save".
  `max_layers` (INT, default 64, min 1, max 512) caps the total images turned into layers
  across all sockets, oldest-first; a larger batch is truncated (first N kept) with a
  logged warning — no silent drop.
- Behavior: canvas = max width × max height across inputs; every image (across every
  socket's batch) becomes one pixel layer, CENTERED, never rescaled; `image_1`'s first
  frame is the BOTTOM layer, later frames/indices stack on top; all layers inside ONE
  group named `group_name`. Written via psd-tools
  (`PSDImage.new` → `create_pixel_layer` → `create_group`) to
  `input/<filename_prefix>_%05d.psd` (unique per execution).
- Channels: the PIL mode is matched to each frame's channel count, never forced —
  1ch→L→RGB, 3ch→RGB (the normal-VAE path), 4ch→**RGBA with alpha PRESERVED** (a
  4-channel IMAGE from a layer-decomposition model like Qwen Image Layered Control
  becomes a PSD layer carrying real per-pixel transparency; forcing it to RGB previously
  byte-misaligned it into tiled/noise garbage). The flatten is alpha-aware ("over"
  compositing) so a fully-opaque input reproduces the old opaque overwrite exactly.
  Outputs: (IMAGE flattened composite, MASK = the composite's accumulated alpha —
  transparent→1, covered→0 — else zeros, STRING = the written psd filename,
  input-relative — usable by Load PSD / addressable by /view).
- Mode semantics MIRROR the Edit in Photoshop node (§6) exactly, applied to the
  freshly-written LAYERED PSD (so the user composites/adjusts LAYERS in Photoshop, then
  the node outputs the SAVED result, flattened): "Wait for first save" BLOCKS execute()
  until the first save then continues the workflow with the edit; "Re-run on every save"
  never blocks (first run opens PS, passes the flat composite through; each save
  auto-queues a re-run consuming the latest edit); "Don't open (composite only)" is the
  old always-flat behavior (never opens PS). The handoff uses origin_kind `bridge_node`
  and edit_in_place on the generated file (ours → safe), so it shares the §6 bridge
  node's blocking-wait, consume, IS_CHANGED, and frontend auto-queue machinery verbatim
  (import from cpsb.nodes; do not duplicate). Default "Wait for first save" makes the
  useful edit-in-Photoshop flow the out-of-box behavior — a flat composite is only ever
  the output when the user has no edit yet or picked "Don't open".
- Consume semantics: `IS_CHANGED` hashes the input images + params, folded with the
  latest-edit hash when an active matching handoff exists; execute() returns the latest
  edit (flattened) when the active handoff's `source_hash` matches the current inputs'
  hash — the §6/§6b consume pattern.
- **Append into an existing document** (v0.5.20). Widgets, all appended at the END of
  `required` (ComfyUI matches saved widget values BY POSITION, so anywhere else silently
  shifts every existing workflow's values): `append_to_existing` (BOOLEAN, default False),
  `existing_psd` (COMBO over `.psd`/`.psb` in the input dir), `existing_psd_path` (STRING
  override, used verbatim when non-empty). Purpose: accumulate many runs into ONE
  reviewable document instead of a slew of separate files.
  - There is no OS file picker available to a ComfyUI node — nodes execute SERVER-SIDE.
    The input-dir COMBO is the idiomatic mechanism (what `PhotoshopLoadPSD` and core
    `LoadImage` already do) and the only one that works when ComfyUI and Photoshop are on
    different machines. `existing_psd_path` is a path on the **ComfyUI** machine.
  - Target resolution mirrors `load_psd.py`'s `_resolve_psd_path`, rejecting traversal
    identically. A target that does not exist yet is CREATED fresh (first-run convenience,
    not an error).
  - **Atomic write** (`_atomic_save`): `PSDImage.save()` opens its destination `"wb"`
    immediately, truncating the existing file before writing a byte — a mid-save failure
    would leave the user's accumulated document unopenable. Writes to a `mkstemp` temp
    file in the SAME directory (guaranteeing one filesystem, so the final step is a true
    atomic rename) and `os.replace()`s only after `save()` fully returns; on any exception
    the temp file is removed and the target is byte-for-byte untouched.
  - Guards: a non-RGB target is REFUSED naming its actual mode (psd-tools would silently
    desaturate/convert instead of erroring); a canvas-size mismatch WARNS naming both
    sizes and proceeds (psd-tools has no canvas-resize API, so a larger image is clipped).
  - Run grouping: each append lands in `"<group_name> <N>"`, N = 1 + the highest existing
    same-prefixed numbered group in the target, so runs stay navigable.
  - **Duplicate-append avoidance**: `append_to_existing` and the resolved target are folded
    into BOTH hashes (identity → switching targets supersedes a stale handoff; inputs →
    IS_CHANGED forces re-execution). Within one identity the real append happens AT MOST
    ONCE: if an active handoff for the node already matches the current identity (e.g. a
    re-queue of "Wait for first save" before any save), the append is SKIPPED — outputs are
    still computed from the same centering math, but nothing further is written.
  - Appending changes only WHERE this run's layers are written. IMAGE/MASK outputs stay
    this run's own flattened composite, never the whole accumulated document, and `mode`
    dispatch is unchanged.
- **Handoff identity is mode-FREE** (fixed v0.5.18 — this node previously had neither
  reuse nor supersede, which is what made "Wait for first save" hang forever and spawned
  a document per run). Two distinct hashes now:
  - `_compute_identity_hash` (images + `group_name` + `layer_name`) is what a handoff's
    `source_hash` records and what reuse/supersede is keyed on. Deliberately excludes
    `mode` and `filename_prefix`, matching `compute_source_hash`'s pixels-only contract.
    Folding `mode` in was the bug: flipping the widget with identical pixels changed the
    recorded identity, so the already-open handoff could never match again — it was
    stranded as a live but unreachable Photoshop document while a second one was created
    underneath it. The user then saved document A while execute() waited on document B,
    and blocked until timeout.
  - `_compute_inputs_hash` (identity + `filename_prefix` + `mode`) stays mode-sensitive
    and is `IS_CHANGED`'s job ONLY.
- Reuse/supersede now mirrors §6's bridge node exactly: an active `bridge_node` handoff
  for this node is REUSED (its `source.psd` is never rewritten — the user's in-progress
  layers live in it); it is superseded only when the identity hash genuinely differs, and
  also when switching to "Don't open (composite only)". A reused handoff in a NON-BLOCKING
  mode does NOT relaunch Photoshop (same rule as §6): "Re-run on every save" re-executes on
  every save, so reopening would steal focus and re-issue a Tier-1 OS open each time.
- `ingest_edit` logs an edit arriving for an inactive/superseded handoff at WARNING (was
  INFO), naming the handoff id, node id and status — this class of bug is otherwise
  invisible from the ComfyUI console.

### 6d. Annotate for Edit node

- Class `PhotoshopAnnotate`, display name "Annotate for Edit", category
  `image/photoshop`.
- Inputs: `image` (IMAGE); `instruction` (STRING, multiline, default ""); optional
  `mask` (MASK). Widgets: `annotate_mode` (COMBO: "Pass through" (default) |
  "Open in Photoshop (mask from edits)"); `box_composite` (BOOLEAN, default False).
  Hidden: `unique_id`.
- Outputs: (IMAGE, MASK, STRING instruction, IMAGE annotated). In PS mode the IMAGE is
  the SAVED composite EXCLUDING the `Instructions` layer (so any edit the user made to
  the base image BAKES IN); pass-through mode passes the input image through unchanged.
  STRING is the instruction verbatim.
- The four outputs cover the three views of an annotated edit, so nothing needs a fifth
  socket (product-owner question, 2026-07-18: "there are three slots — should they map
  to that?"):
  - **everything but the annotation** → `image` (clean, base edits baked in). Feed this
    plus `mask` to an inpainting/mask-driven model.
  - **just the annotation** → `mask`.
  - **image and annotation combined** → `annotated`. Feed this to a visual-prompt edit
    model (the "edit what I circled" convention) — it needs no mask input.
- `annotated` is the combined view, and `box_composite` selects the FORM the annotation
  takes in it (revised v0.5.19):
  - `True` → a 4px red unfilled rectangle at the final mask's bounding box, drawn on the
    CLEAN image. The tidy box REPLACES the raw strokes rather than adding to them: a
    marking blob plus a box around it is noisier for a box-prompt model than the box
    alone. This is the mark convention Kontext/Qwen-Image-Edit document responding to,
    and is what `examples/annotate-qwen-image-edit.json` wires into Qwen.
  - `False` → the full PS composite: the base image with the user's REAL painted strokes
    on top, in their real colors. Before v0.5.19 this branch returned the image
    completely unannotated, making the output indistinguishable from `image` and leaving
    no way to see what had been painted.
  - Pass-through (ComfyUI-only) mode has no Photoshop document and therefore no strokes,
    so `annotated` there stays the unchanged image — the original behavior for that tier.
  - Stroke COLOUR is deliberately NOT yet surfaced as a separate signal (e.g. red=remove,
    green=keep): `_layer_alpha_mask` keeps only alpha. Deferred until a real downstream
    consumer exists; it can be added additively at the tail of the output tuple.
- PS-mode markup uses a dedicated **`Instructions` LAYER** (product-owner redesign
  2026-07-17, replacing the old whole-image pixel diff + scipy morphology, all removed):
  on open the node writes `source.psd` LAYERED — the input image as a base layer + a
  fully-transparent top layer named exactly `Instructions`. The user draws on that layer
  to mark the region (any color) and may also edit the base image. On save the node
  reopens the saved layered `source.psd`:
  - **`Instructions` top-level layer found** → MASK = that layer's alpha (read via
    `layer.composite(viewport=psd.viewbox)` — `.composite()` rather than `.topil()` because
    it applies BOTH a layer's own alpha and any layer mask the user added in Photoshop, and
    the viewport re-expands Photoshop's trimmed layer bounds to the full canvas);
    IMAGE = composite of all OTHER layers (`layer_filter` excluding it by identity).
  - **Writing that transparent layer needs care** (fixed v0.5.16 after a user report of
    "a black layer with a black mask; drawing on it does nothing"): psd-tools decides where
    a layer's alpha goes from the PARENT document's `pil_mode` at `create_pixel_layer` time.
    For an `RGB` document it converts the RGBA source down to RGB — compositing a fully
    transparent source onto BLACK — and re-attaches the discarded alpha as an all-zero
    USER_LAYER_MASK, which Photoshop renders as an opaque black layer behind a mask that
    hides every brush stroke. The write therefore bumps `header.channels` 3→4 for the
    duration of that single call (so `pil_mode` reports `RGBA` and the alpha lands in the
    layer's own TRANSPARENCY_MASK channel `-1`, with no `-2` mask), then restores it before
    `save()` so the file stays a plain 3-channel RGB document with no stray alpha channel.
    Structure — not `composite()` — is what distinguishes the two shapes: `composite()`
    applies the mask and so reports a perfectly transparent layer under EITHER, which is
    exactly why the original test suite missed the bug.
  - **renamed/deleted** → treated as a plain image: IMAGE = full composite, MASK = None →
    falls through to the mask precedence below.
  - NB: REMOTE Tier 2 degrades to the empty-`Instructions` case (the plugin uploads a flat
    PNG and never overwrites the server-side layered `source.psd`) until layered upload
    lands.
- MASK resolution precedence: (1) the PS-mode `Instructions`-layer mask above; (2) else
  the `mask` input socket (ComfyUI-only tier: MaskEditor or any mask source upstream);
  (3) else zeros.
- PS mode BLOCKS (product-owner update 2026-07-17): on execute with no matching edit,
  write the LAYERED handoff (origin_kind `bridge_node`), open Photoshop, and BLOCK via
  `manager.wait_for_edit` (like the §6 bridge node's "Wait for first save") until the user
  marks up and saves; then read the saved PSD (above). Cancel/timeout/error interrupt via
  InterruptProcessingException (§8, incl. ComfyUI's native cancel). The open logs a
  `cpsb annotate:` trail so a "didn't open" report is diagnosable.

## 7. Photoshop discovery & launch (Tier 1, backend)

Order: settings `photoshop_path` override → platform discovery → error.
- macOS: `open -b com.adobe.Photoshop <psd>`; on failure enumerate installed apps via
  `mdfind "kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier == 'com.adobe.Photoshop'"`, prefer the highest
  year/version, `open -a <app path> <psd>`.
- Windows: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\Photoshop.exe`,
  else enumerate `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Adobe\Photoshop\<ver>` `ApplicationPath`, newest first;
  launch `Popen([exe, psd])`. `os.startfile(psd)` only as a last resort (association may
  not be Photoshop — surface a warning in the response so the frontend can toast it).
- Tier 1 gating (`tier1_available:false`, with `tier1_reason` ∈ `"headless-server"` |
  `"docker"` | `"wsl"` | `null`): Linux without `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`;
  `/.dockerenv` present; WSL (`microsoft` in `platform.release().lower()`).
  "No Photoshop installed" is NOT a gating reason — it is only discoverable at launch
  time and surfaces through the launch-failure path (§2 note). The frontend must NOT
  hard-disable Tier 1 based on `window.location.hostname` — a non-localhost hostname
  (e.g. ComfyUI under `--listen`, browsed via a LAN address on the same machine) does
  not imply the client is elsewhere; hostname cannot distinguish the two cases at all.
  Launch calls are blocking subprocess work and MUST run off the event loop
  (`asyncio.to_thread`) when invoked from route/websocket handlers.

**Client locality (the authority on "is the browser on the server's machine"):** the
server decides, deterministically, per request: the requester is local iff the HTTP
request's peer address is an address this machine owns — tested by attempting to bind
a throwaway socket to `request.remote` (bind succeeds only for locally-owned
addresses; handles loopback AND the same-machine-via-LAN-address case that hostname
checks get wrong). If a forwarding header (`X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP`) is present,
the peer address is a proxy's, so the client is treated as remote/unknown (fails
safe into the §2 confirm flow). Non-local clients don't lose Tier 1 — they get the
§2 `428 client_remote` confirm ("Photoshop will open on <server_name>") with an
explicit, per-browser-remembered opt-in, because launching on the server's screen is
useless to someone sitting elsewhere but legitimate for VNC/dual-screen setups.

---

## 8. Frontend ↔ backend conventions

- All frontend calls go through `api.fetchApi("/cpsb/...")` (ComfyUI's wrapper — it
  handles the api prefix and client id).
- The context-menu integration registers via `getNodeMenuItems` when available,
  falling back to a `getExtraMenuOptions` monkeypatch on older frontends (spike §8-1
  will confirm image-region behavior; menu items appear regardless via the node menu).
- Menu items offered on any node whose `node.imgs` is non-empty: "Open in Photoshop"
  (no active handoff), or "Edit Original in Photoshop" + "Start Fresh in Photoshop"
  (active handoff exists — tracked client-side from `cpsb.status` events + initial
  `/cpsb/status` fetch).
- Batch nodes (`node.imgs.length > 1`): open the **currently displayed** image
  (`node.imageIndex ?? 0`); an "Open all N in Photoshop" item appears for N ≤ 8.
- Frontend settings (ComfyUI settings API, ids): `cpsb.autoQueue` (bool, default true),
  `cpsb.showUpgradeBanner` (bool, default true).

---

## 9. Versioning

Backend, frontend JS, and plugin each carry a semver string; `hello`/`hello_ack`
exchange them. During 0.x, a minor-version mismatch between plugin and backend logs a
console warning and shows a gallery banner ("Photoshop panel v0.1.0 ≠ server v0.2.0 —
update the plugin") but does not refuse the connection.
